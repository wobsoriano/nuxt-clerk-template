![Nuxt_js Clerk Template · 11 39am · 02-03](https://github.com/wobsoriano/nuxt-clerk-template/assets/13049130/2ef8cc8a-80e9-4e9f-994e-904ccaf48b36)

This template shows how to use [Clerk](https://www.clerk.com) in a Nuxt application. It is a direct port of the [Next.js starter template](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-nextjs-demo-app-router).

Clerk is a developer-first authentication and user management solution. This starter uses [Vue Clerk](https://vue-clerk.vercel.app), which provides pre-built Vue components and composables for login, signup, user profile, and organization management. [Vue Clerk](https://vue-clerk.vercel.app) is designed to be easy to use and customize, and can be dropped into any Vue or Nuxt application.

This template allows you to get started with Clerk and Nuxt in a matter of minutes and includes:

- Fully functional auth flow with login, signup, and a protected page
- Customized Clerk components with Tailwind CSS
- Composables for accessing user data and authentication state
- Organizations for multi-tenant applications
